# Change Log
All notable changes to “Filo - The cable simulator” will be documented in this file.

## [1.4]

### Added
- Support for arbitrary planes in cable bodies.

### Fixed
-Bug in XZ plane handedness, which caused incorrect link orientation in cable splitting operations.


## [1.3]

### Added
- All links now have a "slack" attribute that lets you add extra cable between that link and the following one.
Useful when you don't want the cable to start completely tensed up.

## [1.2]

### Added
- Added "Joints" property to Cable class, lets you get a readonly list of all joints in the cable.
- You can now query per-joint strain, jacobian and impulse magnitudes.

### Changed
- Capped the spools' amount of stored cable in editor to be >= 0.

### Fixed
- Initialization bug in spools (Hybrid links) that caused the visual appearance of spools in editor and their initial behavior at runtime.

## [1.1]

### Added
- Dynamic joint merge/split system. This results in cables that can generate and remove contacts with new bodies at runtime.
- Attachment links can now generate/consume cable dynamically. This allows to change the cable rest length at runtime.


## [1.0.0]
- Initial release.
